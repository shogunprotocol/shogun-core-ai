# Shōgun Core AI - Advanced Financial Intelligence Engine

Shōgun Core AI is an institutional-grade financial intelligence engine designed for institutions, family offices, and high-volume CoreDAO participants. The system leverages real-time on-chain and off-chain data to optimize yield generation and capital deployment, powering the Intelligent Wrapped BTC (IWBTC) protocol that transforms passive Bitcoin holdings into dynamic, yield-generating financial instruments.

## Core Technology

This is not a simple arbitrage bot. Shōgun Core AI operates as a sophisticated financial analyst with the computational capacity to process thousands of data streams simultaneously, making intelligent capital allocation decisions at unprecedented speed.

### Intelligent Wrapped BTC (IWBTC)
IWBTC represents the first intelligent wrapped Bitcoin implementation on CoreDAO, specifically designed for institutional clients and high-volume users seeking enhanced CoreDAO ecosystem participation. When users deposit BTC, it's converted to IWBTC and placed into a smart vault powered by Shōgun's AI engine. The system actively:

- Processes real-time market data from multiple DEX protocols including IceCreamSwap, ArcherSwap, ShadowSwap, and LFGSwap
- Executes sophisticated arbitrage strategies including triangular arbitrage patterns (WCORE→ICE→SCORE→WCORE)
- Performs AI-driven dynamic rebalancing across multiple yield-generating strategies, generating significant transaction volume on CoreDAO
- Provides custom yield optimization experiences tailored to individual institutional risk profiles and volume requirements
- Maintains complete transparency and security through on-chain execution on CoreDAO
- Leverages both on-chain price feeds and off-chain market intelligence for optimal decision-making
